# Spring Boot Service With Kotlin and DDD
 - Based off of [Microsoft's guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/microservices-architecture/microservice-ddd-cqrs-patterns/) for .NET and C# microservices
 - This service was designed as a monolith but thanks to the power of DDD, breaking it down into microservices would be trivial. The `foobar` package, for example, is another bounded context and would ideally live in its own microservice.
